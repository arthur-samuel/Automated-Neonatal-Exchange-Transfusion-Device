# Automated-Neonatal-Exchange-Transfusion-Device#

Overview
Welcome to the README for the Automated Neonatal Exchange Transfusion Device project. This repository contains the prototype control system developed in MATLAB, the hardware programming using Arduino, and the comprehensive diagramatic representation of the entire system.

Project Description
1. MATLAB Prototype
The MATLAB prototype serves as the control system for the Automated Neonatal Exchange Transfusion Device. It provides a simulated environment for testing and refining the control algorithms before implementation on the hardware. To access the MATLAB prototype, navigate to the MATLAB Prototype directory.

2. Arduino Hardware Programming
The hardware of the Automated Neonatal Exchange Transfusion Device is programmed using Arduino. The code is responsible for the seamless integration and synchronization of components, ensuring precise and reliable functionality during the exchange transfusion procedure. To access the Arduino code, navigate to the Arduino Programming directory.

3. System Diagrams
Explore the Diagrams directory for comprehensive schematic representations of the entire device. These diagrams provide an overview of the system architecture, helping to understand the interconnections between different components.

Getting Started
To set up and test the MATLAB prototype, follow the instructions in the MATLAB Prototype README. For the Arduino hardware programming, refer to the Arduino Programming README.
