Many people have worked on exchange transfusion quite a bit since it was brought to the limelight in the 20th century. The objective of these works is to add a feature that automates the system  but, due to technological challenges, most of them have not been widely adopted globally.
According to (1 ) fully automated simultaneous umbilical arteriovenous blood exchange transfusion in both term and late preterm infants with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is an example of such automation attempts. In this study, two different catherization exchange transfusion techniques was employed  to improve the efficacy and efficiency of the device and the traditional one-way exchange transfusion—used in the treatment of infant jaundice—was compared.
Babies with gestational ages more than 34 weeks were included in the research. A total of 107 exchange transfusions were carried out on 86 infants. In all, the umbilical vein (UV) group consisted of 54 infants who had had 69 exchange transfusions, whereas the UV/UA group contained 32 infants who had received 38 exchange transfusions.
According to the findings, the fully automated UV/UA approach had greater bilirubin level decreases than the conventional UV technique both immediately following exchange transfusion and eight hours later. Also, the UV/UA approach had a shorter intensive phototherapy period than the UV method after exchange transfusion. When it came to issues linked to exchange transfusions, there was no difference between the two approaches.
At the end of the study they concluded by stating that exchange transfusion utilizing a fully automated UV/UA approach is more effective than a traditional exchange transfusion technique in treating newborn hyperbilirubinemia and has no extra adverse effects. Also, it is more physiological than the conventional method since it reduces variations in intravascular pressure and blood volume during exchange transfusion.(1 )
