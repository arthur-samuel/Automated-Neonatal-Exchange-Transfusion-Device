the command Genration
the information for what ever is to be done is inputed  

Power on and power off
toggle 
volume


the control
Decision maker of the entire system 
controls the fail safe 
the occlusion

occlusion detection
basically contains algorithms to detect the occlusion

supervisory
modelling the reference angle of the motor

motor controller
supplying voltage to the motor for it to work

plant 
it houses the syringe
the dc motor and the delivery line.

for the motor the blue side means it is the electrical part 
while the green side represent the mechanical part

slide
friction and compliance of the plunger can be non linear and therefore the effect has to calculated.

NB: 
the occlusion is tlike if there is a clot in any form of the blood or a clotting there will be a reaction to indicate it.


1. Compare the motor speed and the delivery line pressure of the motor line


Integration and Testing


in preparaing the ppt:

first talk about the flaws of the existing models

talk about the testing

and start with the matlab analysis
